Overhunting can lead to extinction. Consider taking up Animal Husbandry to ensure a long-lasting supply of food and leather for your civilization.
Cannibalism is a feature, but eating other people might make you valid.

You can disarm mines and tripmines by clicking on a trap with bare hands or a wirecutter. Be wary that, while success gives a grenade/mine, failure on AP mines/tripmines yields a deadly result to you and everyone near you, enemy included. It is much easier to spot a tripmine than a normal one.
Butchering an animal with GRAB intent active will output pelts instead of leather.
Use an empty hand with grab intent on a water source to drink from it.
