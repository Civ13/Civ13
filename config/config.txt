### IPINTEL:
### This allows you to detect likely proxies by checking ips against getipintel.net
## Rating to warn at: (0.90 is good, 1 is 100% likely to be a spammer/proxy, 0.8 is 80%, etc) anything equal to or higher then this number triggers an admin warning
#IPINTEL_RATING_BAD 0.90
## Contact email, (required to use the service, leaving blank or default disables IPINTEL)
#IPINTEL_EMAIL ch@nge.me
## How long to save good matches (ipintel rate limits to 15 per minute and 500 per day. so this shouldn't be too low, getipintel.net suggests 6 hours, time is in hours) (Your ip will get banned if you go over 500 a day too many times)
#IPINTEL_SAVE_GOOD 12
## How long to save bad matches (these numbers can change as ips change hands, best not to save these for too long in case somebody gets a new ip used by a spammer/proxy before.)
#IPINTEL_SAVE_BAD 3
## Domain name to query (leave commented out for the default, only needed if you pay getipintel.net for more querys)
#IPINTEL_DOMAIN check.getipintel.net

## Uncomment to allow web client connections
ALLOW_WEBCLIENT

## Uncomment to restrict web client connections to byond members
## This makes for a nice pay gate to cut down on ban evading, as the webclient's cid system isn't that great
## byond membership starts at $10 for 3 months, so to use the webclient to evade, they would have sink 10 bucks in each evade.
