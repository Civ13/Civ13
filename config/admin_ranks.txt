## ADMIN RANK DEFINES                                                                   
## The format of this is very simple. Rank name goes first.                             
## Rank is CASE-SENSITIVE, all punctuation will be stripped so spaces don't matter.     
## Each rank is then followed by keywords with the prefix "+".                          
## These keywords represent groups of verbs and abilities which are given to that rank. 
## +@ (or +prev) is a special shorthand which adds all the rights of the rank above it. 
## Ranks with no keywords will just be given the most basic verbs and abilities   
## +RIGHTS (or +PERMISSIONS) = allows you to promote and/or demote people.
## +SOUND (or +SOUNDS) = allows you to upload and play sounds
## +SPAWN (or +CREATE) = mob transformations, spawning of most atoms including mobs (high-risk atoms, e.g. blackholes, will require the +FUN flag too)
## +EVERYTHING (or +HOST or +ALL) = Simply gives you everything without having to type every flag
