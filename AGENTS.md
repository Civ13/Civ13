# Civ13 - Agent guide

## Language & toolchain
NEVER use "—": always use "-" instead.
- **DM** (DreamMaker) - BYOND's proprietary language. Sources have `.dm` extension.
- **Entry point**: `civ13.dme` - the DM Environment file.
- **Build**: `dm civ13.dme` (Windows) or `DreamMaker civ13.dme` (Linux). Outputs `civ13.dmb` + `civ13.rsc`.
- **Lint**: `./dreamchecker.exe` (SpacemanDMM static analyzer). Config in `SpacemanDMM.toml` (sets `dreamchecker = true` for the langserver).
- **Required BYOND version**: 516.1681 (enforced in CI and `.vscode/tasks.json`).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`): installs BYOND 516.1681 on Ubuntu, runs `DreamMaker -max_errors 0 civ13.dme`, fails on any errors or warnings. The MCP protocol workflow separately tests the local tooling on Windows and Linux; it does not run gameplay.

## Code structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `code/` | Core game code: atoms, mobs, objects, turfs, helpers, defines |
| `code/__defines/` | Global constants, macros, flags |
| `code/modules/1713/` | Bulk of Civ13-specific content (apparel, jobs, weapons, vehicles, sieges, etc.) |
| `code/modules/admin/` | Admin tools and verbs |
| `maps/` | Map (`.dmm`) files organized by era (e.g. `maps/5000bc/`, `maps/1913/`, `maps/nomads/`) |
| `config/` | Server configuration (`config.txt`, `admin_ranks.txt`, `host.txt`) |
| `scripts/` | Linux deployment scripts (`launch.py`, `updateserver.py`) |
| `UI/` | HTML/CSS interface files |
| `icons/` | Game sprites (`.dmi` files) |
| `sound/` | Audio assets |
| `SQL/` | Database integration (Discord bot OOC bridge via file polling) |

## VSCode integration (`.vscode/tasks.json`)

Available tasks:
- **`dm civ13.dme`** - build the project (default build task)
- **`DreamChecker`** - run static analysis
- **`OpenDream Build`** - compile with DMCompiler (`--version=516.1681`)
- **`Build and Check`** - sequential: build then lint

## OpenDream

An experimental open-source BYOND reimplementation. `.vscode/launch.json` has an "OpenDream: Build & Run" configuration using `DMCompiler.exe` and `Robust.Server.exe`. The JSON output is `civ13.json`.

## Maps

- Maps use lowercase names with `_` for spaces.
- WIP maps go in `maps/WIP/`.
- No second z-levels unless same size as main level.
- Map backups should use Git, not saved copies in the repo.

### DMM format rules

- All tile keys within a map **must be the same length** (all 2-char or all 1-char). Mixing breaks BYOND's parser.
- Every grid row must have exactly `world.maxx` tile keys. Different row widths cause load failures.
- Grid rows in the file are ordered top-to-bottom (Y=maxy first, Y=1 last).
- `(1,1,1)` is the bottom-left tile of the map.
- Tile definitions can layer multiple atoms: `(/obj/foo, /turf/floor/bar, /area/baz)`. Objects are listed before the turf, turf before area. The first element is rendered on top.
- Vars on objects use `{var = value}` syntax within tile defs: `(/obj/foo{tube_id = 3}, ...)`. Multiple vars separated by `;`.
- Object placement: to put an object on a floor tile, define a new tile key that includes the object + the floor turf + the area, then use that key in the grid at the desired position.

### Map metadata

- Each map has a `/obj/map_metadata` subtype that handles game mode logic.
- The metadata object is placed in the DMM at a consistent position (conventionally `(1,1,1)`) on any turf.
- `New()` on the base `/obj/map_metadata` sets `map = src`, clears icon, copies faction lists, and starts background timers.
- Subtypes override `New()` to call `..()` then do map-specific init (spawning datums, registering turfs, etc.).
- `update_win_condition()` drives round-end logic (checked every tick).
- Map IDs are defined as `#define MAP_XXX "XXX"` in `code/__defines/maps.dm`.
- The metadata `.dm` file must be `#include`d in `civ13.dme` **after** any defines it references.
- Win conditions: call `world << "<font>..."` for announcements, set `game_over = TRUE` and `ticker.finished = TRUE` to end the round.

### Player spawning

- Jobs define `spawn_location = "JoinLateXXX"` (a string key).
- Maps place `/obj/effect/landmark{name = "JoinLateXXX"}` objects in the DMM at spawn turfs.
- At load time, `/obj/effect/landmark/New()` stores the turf in `latejoin_turfs[name]` (global assoc list), then `qdel(self)`.
- `job_controller.relocate()` picks a random turf from `latejoin_turfs[spawn_location]` and sets `H.loc = spawnpoint`.
- A mob-level `job_spawn_location` var overrides the job-level value if set.
- Fallback if no landmark found: `locate(48,50,1)` (hardcoded).

### Process scheduler integration

- Codebase uses legacy `/process/` system, not subsystems.
- Create a `/process/subtype` in `code/processes/`, set `name`, `schedule_interval`, `fires_at_gamestates`.
- Register the process var in `code/processes/__processes.dm`.
- `fire()` is called each tick; do your per-tick work there.
- Global singletons should be accessed via `global.xxx` or a `var/xxx` on a global datum.

### Map object placement (codebase-specific)

- Existing maps place objects directly in DMM tile definitions (not spawned in code).
- `/obj/effect/landmark` tiles get `qdel(self)` after registering - they're invisible after load.
- Object tiles stack: `(/obj/chair, /turf/floor, /area/room)` puts a chair on the floor.
- Console/machinery objects use `density = TRUE` and `anchored = TRUE` - they block movement.
- For maps with many objects, define tile keys systematically (e.g., "oa", "ob", "oc"...) to keep things manageable.

## DMI (sprite sheet) file format

DMI files are valid PNGs with an embedded `zTXt` metadata chunk. The chunk keyword is `Description` and its value is zlib-compressed text (after a null-terminator byte following the keyword). Decompressing it yields a plain-text JSON-like DM literal describing every sprite state.

### Extracting metadata (Python)

```python
import struct, zlib, json, re

def read_dmi(path):
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        sig = f.read(8)
        chunks = {}
        while True:
            raw = f.read(8)
            if len(raw) < 8:
                break
            length, ctype = struct.unpack(">I4s", raw)
            ctype = ctype.decode("ascii", errors="replace")
            data = f.read(length)
            crc = f.read(4)  # skip CRC
            if ctype == "zTXt":
                # keyword is null-terminated, rest is zlib data
                nul = data.index(0)
                keyword = data[:nul].decode("ascii")
                compressed = data[nul+2:]  # skip keyword + null + compression type byte
                text = zlib.decompress(compressed).decode("utf-8")
                chunks[keyword] = text
    return chunks.get("Description", "")
```

The returned text is DM source like:

```
// BEGIN DMI
state_name = "icon_state"
    dir = SOUTH
    icon = 'icons/obj/items.dmi'
    frames = 1
    delay = 1
    loop = 0
// END DMI
```

### What's in it

- **state** - `icon_state` name referenced in code (`icon_state = "foo"`)
- **dir** - direction(s): SOUTH=1, NORTH=2, WEST=4, EAST=8, or combinations
- **frames** - number of animation frames
- **delay** - comma-separated frame delays (in ticks, 1 tick = 0.1s default)
- **loop** - animation loop count (0 = infinite)
- **movement** - whether the state is for movement animations
- **hotspot** / **crop** - optional pixel-level metadata

### Quick one-liner (no libraries needed)

```bash
python -c "
import struct,zlib,sys
data=open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()
i=data.find(b'Description\x00\x00')
if i<0: sys.exit(1)
j=data.find(b'IEND')
chunk=data[i+len('Description\x00\x00'):j-4]
print(zlib.decompress(chunk).decode())
" myfile.dmi
```

This lets agents introspect sprite sheets without opening them in a GUI - useful for verifying icon_state names, checking animation frame counts, or auditing unused states.

## Server deployment

- Linux-only for production (scripts use `sudo`, apt, systemd-style paths).
- `scripts/launch.py` - pulls from git, rebuilds, copies config, runs `DreamDaemon`.
- `scripts/paths.txt` defines server paths and ports.
- Config in `config/config.txt` controls gamemodes, ports, hub visibility, logging, etc.
- Discord integration via Civilizationbot (file-based IPC through `SQL/discord2*.txt` files).

## Conventions

- `#define DEBUG` is set in `civ13.dme` (enables custom error handler).
- `_compile_options.dm` controls TESTING, UNIT_TESTS, REFERENCE_TRACKING, etc. - uncomment as needed.
- `.gitignore` excludes compiled outputs (`*.dmb`, `*.rsc`), log files, `data/`, `SQL/`, `dreamchecker.exe`, `civ13.json`, `TODO.md`.

## Agent self-maintenance

This file is read by every agent at session start. If you discover something
useful about the codebase that future agents should know, **update this file**.
Good candidates for additions:

- Gotchas that caused you to waste time (type mismatches, missing procs, naming
  conventions that differ from what you'd expect).
- Workarounds you had to apply and why (e.g. "lerp is reserved, use mix_value").
- Runtime truths: things that compile fine but break at runtime (empty lists
  passed to pick(), world-scan performance, list modification during iteration).
- File locations for subsystems you explored (process schedulers, global singletons,
  landmark systems, etc.).
- Anything you learned from CI failures or compiler warnings that isn't obvious.

When adding, keep it concise and put it under the most relevant existing section.
If nothing fits, create a new section. Prefix your additions with the date and
a brief tag so others can tell when and why it was added (e.g. `<!-- 2026-06-10: subcom audit -->`).

<!-- 2026-10-11: season memory regression -->
- BYOND turf replacement calls `Del()` and preserves sleeping procs. Registry cleanup in `Destroy()` alone does not handle replacement; grass registration is maintained by grass `New()`/`Del()`.
- Dirt recovery uses an identity token so old sleeping recovery chains stop after turf replacement. Obsolete waits release their token when they wake (up to 20 minutes), without deleting live entities.
- `scripts/test-season-memory.ps1 -ByondBin <BYOND-bin-directory>` executes production turf lifecycle bodies in an isolated world, with accelerated recovery waits and temporary output. It checks repeated replacement, bounded grass registration, one recovery chain per dirt turf, and planted-soil behavior. Synthetic process memory is not full-game memory evidence.
<!-- 2026-10-11: evidence harness review -->
Native BYOND world.Export returns the remote Topic value, and its caller address includes a port (127.0.0.1:port). Reject empty/non-JSON replies and authenticate the tested commit before reporting evidence success. PowerShell native Git failures need explicit LASTEXITCODE checks; ErrorActionPreference alone is insufficient. The isolated evidence launcher must verify daemon readiness and clean its unique temporary DME/DMB/RSC outputs.
## Local MCP tooling

<!-- 2026-10-11: chemistry verification -->
Chemical recipe IDs do not register reagents: each product needs a matching
`/datum/reagent` ID or mixing can consume inputs without producing the result.
`tests/chemistry/run.py` compiles production sources with normal world startup
disabled and runs bounded reactions in temporary storage. CI also runs its
wrong-feedstock negative control; this does not replace gameplay verification.
Linux DreamDaemon safe mode rejects an absolute `-log` path. Use a relative
log filename with the runtime working directory set to temporary storage.

<!-- 2026-10-11: Civ13 MCP integration -->
`tools/mcp/README.md` documents the bounded stdio server and Codex configuration.
Run `npm ci --prefix tools/mcp` then `npm test --prefix tools/mcp` for isolated
protocol/path/cancellation tests. Set `CIV13_DM_COMPILER` to a trusted absolute
DreamMaker path to additionally check its banner and a fixed temporary fixture.
Source discovery is lexical; include diagnostics do not replace compilation.
Both compiler tools create temporary storage/processes. No live game, Topic or
production administration tools are exposed. Never configure this server from a
worktree that will be archived while the MCP entry still points to it.

<!-- 2026-10-11: wire power verification -->
`tests/power/README.md` documents isolated cable accounting regressions and an
opt-in full-game capture adapter. `scripts/test-power.ps1` requires an explicit
BYOND bin path; CI also compiles the excluded gameplay adapter. Powerflow and
currentflow are instantaneous capacity and reserved demand, not stored energy.

<!-- 2026-10-11: GitHub comment review -->
Tools under tools/comment-review provide an authenticated-gh local collector and a disabled-by-default Codex event workflow. Preserve ignored data/comment-review cursors/receipts across worktree cleanup; inspect current API data before acknowledging or posting. The local collector does not install a scheduler or consume API credentials. See tools/comment-review/README.md for event trust boundaries and activation settings.
## Train verification

<!-- 2026-10-11: train collision investigation -->
`code/modules/1713/trains.dm` connections point from leader to follower. Reject
coupling cycles and stop failed movement before recursively moving followers;
`Bumped` is deferred by the movable atom's bump callback. Run bounded isolated
regressions with `tests/train_collision/run.ps1 -ByondBin <516.1681-bin>` and real
game callback/locomotive-loop tests with `tests/train_collision/run-game.ps1`.
The full-game probe uses temporary state and outbound-hook controls. Its optional
visual mode needs separate capture authorization; it never proves production
crash behavior. Do not replace required gameplay captures with fixture output.
