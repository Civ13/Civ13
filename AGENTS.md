# Civ13 — Agent guide

## Language & toolchain

- **DM** (DreamMaker) — BYOND's proprietary language. Sources have `.dm` extension.
- **Entry point**: `civ13.dme` — the DM Environment file.
- **Build**: `dm civ13.dme` (Windows) or `DreamMaker civ13.dme` (Linux). Outputs `civ13.dmb` + `civ13.rsc`.
- **Lint**: `./dreamchecker.exe` (SpacemanDMM static analyzer). Config in `SpacemanDMM.toml` (sets `dreamchecker = true` for the langserver).
- **Required BYOND version**: 516.1681 (enforced in CI and `.vscode/tasks.json`).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`): installs BYOND 516.1681 on Ubuntu, runs `DreamMaker -max_errors 0 civ13.dme`, fails on any errors or warnings. That's the only CI check — no unit tests.

## Code structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `code/` | Core game code: atoms, mobs, objects, turfs, helpers, defines |
| `code/__defines/` | Global constants, macros, flags |
| `code/modules/1713/` | Bulk of Civ13-specific content (apparel, jobs, weapons, vehicles, sieges, etc.) |
| `code/modules/admin/` | Admin tools and verbs |
| `maps/` | Map (`.dmm`) files organized by era (e.g. `maps/5000bc/`, `maps/1913/`, `maps/nomads/`) |
| `config/` | Server configuration (`config.txt`, `admin_ranks.txt`, `host.txt`) |
| `scripts/` | Linux deployment scripts (`launch.py`, `updateserver.py`) |
| `UI/` | HTML/CSS interface files |
| `icons/` | Game sprites (`.dmi` files) |
| `sound/` | Audio assets |
| `SQL/` | Database integration (Discord bot OOC bridge via file polling) |

## VSCode integration (`.vscode/tasks.json`)

Available tasks:
- **`dm civ13.dme`** — build the project (default build task)
- **`DreamChecker`** — run static analysis
- **`OpenDream Build`** — compile with DMCompiler (`--version=516.1681`)
- **`Build and Check`** — sequential: build then lint

## OpenDream

An experimental open-source BYOND reimplementation. `.vscode/launch.json` has an "OpenDream: Build & Run" configuration using `DMCompiler.exe` and `Robust.Server.exe`. The JSON output is `civ13.json`.

## Maps

- Maps use lowercase names with `_` for spaces.
- WIP maps go in `maps/WIP/`.
- No second z-levels unless same size as main level.
- Map backups should use Git, not saved copies in the repo.

### DMM format rules

- All tile keys within a map **must be the same length** (all 2-char or all 1-char). Mixing breaks BYOND's parser.
- Every grid row must have exactly `world.maxx` tile keys. Different row widths cause load failures.
- Grid rows in the file are ordered top-to-bottom (Y=maxy first, Y=1 last).
- `(1,1,1)` is the bottom-left tile of the map.
- Tile definitions can layer multiple atoms: `(/obj/foo, /turf/floor/bar, /area/baz)`. Objects are listed before the turf, turf before area. The first element is rendered on top.
- Vars on objects use `{var = value}` syntax within tile defs: `(/obj/foo{tube_id = 3}, ...)`. Multiple vars separated by `;`.
- Object placement: to put an object on a floor tile, define a new tile key that includes the object + the floor turf + the area, then use that key in the grid at the desired position.

### Map metadata

- Each map has a `/obj/map_metadata` subtype that handles game mode logic.
- The metadata object is placed in the DMM at a consistent position (conventionally `(1,1,1)`) on any turf.
- `New()` on the base `/obj/map_metadata` sets `map = src`, clears icon, copies faction lists, and starts background timers.
- Subtypes override `New()` to call `..()` then do map-specific init (spawning datums, registering turfs, etc.).
- `update_win_condition()` drives round-end logic (checked every tick).
- Map IDs are defined as `#define MAP_XXX "XXX"` in `code/__defines/maps.dm`.
- The metadata `.dm` file must be `#include`d in `civ13.dme` **after** any defines it references.
- Win conditions: call `world << "<font>..."` for announcements, set `game_over = TRUE` and `ticker.finished = TRUE` to end the round.

### Player spawning

- Jobs define `spawn_location = "JoinLateXXX"` (a string key).
- Maps place `/obj/effect/landmark{name = "JoinLateXXX"}` objects in the DMM at spawn turfs.
- At load time, `/obj/effect/landmark/New()` stores the turf in `latejoin_turfs[name]` (global assoc list), then `qdel(self)`.
- `job_controller.relocate()` picks a random turf from `latejoin_turfs[spawn_location]` and sets `H.loc = spawnpoint`.
- A mob-level `job_spawn_location` var overrides the job-level value if set.
- Fallback if no landmark found: `locate(48,50,1)` (hardcoded).

### Process scheduler integration

- Codebase uses legacy `/process/` system, not subsystems.
- Create a `/process/subtype` in `code/processes/`, set `name`, `schedule_interval`, `fires_at_gamestates`.
- Register the process var in `code/processes/__processes.dm`.
- `fire()` is called each tick; do your per-tick work there.
- Global singletons should be accessed via `global.xxx` or a `var/xxx` on a global datum.

### Map object placement (codebase-specific)

- Existing maps place objects directly in DMM tile definitions (not spawned in code).
- `/obj/effect/landmark` tiles get `qdel(self)` after registering — they're invisible after load.
- Object tiles stack: `(/obj/chair, /turf/floor, /area/room)` puts a chair on the floor.
- Console/machinery objects use `density = TRUE` and `anchored = TRUE` — they block movement.
- For maps with many objects, define tile keys systematically (e.g., "oa", "ob", "oc"...) to keep things manageable.

## Server deployment

- Linux-only for production (scripts use `sudo`, apt, systemd-style paths).
- `scripts/launch.py` — pulls from git, rebuilds, copies config, runs `DreamDaemon`.
- `scripts/paths.txt` defines server paths and ports.
- Config in `config/config.txt` controls gamemodes, ports, hub visibility, logging, etc.
- Discord integration via Civilizationbot (file-based IPC through `SQL/discord2*.txt` files).

## Conventions

- `#define DEBUG` is set in `civ13.dme` (enables custom error handler).
- `_compile_options.dm` controls TESTING, UNIT_TESTS, REFERENCE_TRACKING, etc. — uncomment as needed.
- `.gitignore` excludes compiled outputs (`*.dmb`, `*.rsc`), log files, `data/`, `SQL/`, `dreamchecker.exe`, `civ13.json`, `TODO.md`.

## Agent self-maintenance

This file is read by every agent at session start. If you discover something
useful about the codebase that future agents should know, **update this file**.
Good candidates for additions:

- Gotchas that caused you to waste time (type mismatches, missing procs, naming
  conventions that differ from what you'd expect).
- Workarounds you had to apply and why (e.g. "lerp is reserved, use mix_value").
- Runtime truths: things that compile fine but break at runtime (empty lists
  passed to pick(), world-scan performance, list modification during iteration).
- File locations for subsystems you explored (process schedulers, global singletons,
  landmark systems, etc.).
- Anything you learned from CI failures or compiler warnings that isn't obvious.

When adding, keep it concise and put it under the most relevant existing section.
If nothing fits, create a new section. Prefix your additions with the date and
a brief tag so others can tell when and why it was added (e.g. `<!-- 2026-06-10: subcom audit -->`).
