# Sprites: scoped agent notes

Read only the entries relevant to the paths or behavior being changed.
Code paths and commands below are relative to the repository root unless
shown as Markdown links. These dated notes preserve subsystem contracts
and historical evidence; they are not a task-wide completion checklist.
Use the root [PR completion policy](../../../CODEX.md) for the finish line.

Explicit restrictions on live actions, held runners, credentials and feature
activation still apply to those actions. Missing native, graphical or
save/load evidence belongs in the report and never blocks a source fix.
Do not turn an evidence limitation into a new approval requirement.

## DMI (sprite sheet) file format

DMI files are valid PNGs with an embedded `zTXt` metadata chunk. The chunk keyword is `Description` and its value is zlib-compressed text (after a null-terminator byte following the keyword). Decompressing it yields a plain-text JSON-like DM literal describing every sprite state.

### Extracting metadata (Python)

```python
import struct, zlib, json, re

def read_dmi(path):
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        sig = f.read(8)
        chunks = {}
        while True:
            raw = f.read(8)
            if len(raw) < 8:
                break
            length, ctype = struct.unpack(">I4s", raw)
            ctype = ctype.decode("ascii", errors="replace")
            data = f.read(length)
            crc = f.read(4)  # skip CRC
            if ctype == "zTXt":
                # keyword is null-terminated, rest is zlib data
                nul = data.index(0)
                keyword = data[:nul].decode("ascii")
                compressed = data[nul+2:]  # skip keyword + null + compression type byte
                text = zlib.decompress(compressed).decode("utf-8")
                chunks[keyword] = text
    return chunks.get("Description", "")
```

The returned text is DM source like:

```
// BEGIN DMI
state_name = "icon_state"
    dir = SOUTH
    icon = 'icons/obj/items.dmi'
    frames = 1
    delay = 1
    loop = 0
// END DMI
```

### What's in it

- **state** - `icon_state` name referenced in code (`icon_state = "foo"`)
- **dir** - direction(s): SOUTH=1, NORTH=2, WEST=4, EAST=8, or combinations
- **frames** - number of animation frames
- **delay** - comma-separated frame delays (in ticks, 1 tick = 0.1s default)
- **loop** - animation loop count (0 = infinite)
- **movement** - whether the state is for movement animations
- **hotspot** / **crop** - optional pixel-level metadata

### Quick one-liner (no libraries needed)

```bash
py -3 -c "
import struct,zlib,sys
data=open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()
i=data.find(b'Description\x00\x00')
if i<0: sys.exit(1)
j=data.find(b'IEND')
chunk=data[i+len('Description\x00\x00'):j-4]
print(zlib.decompress(chunk).decode())
" myfile.dmi
```

This lets agents introspect sprite sheets without opening them in a GUI - useful for verifying icon_state names, checking animation frame counts, or auditing unused states.

<!-- 2026-10-11: compiled sprite audit -->
- `tests/sprites/run.py --byond-bin <516.1681-bin> --output <temporary-json>` inventories compiled inherited item/structure/machinery defaults without constructing them or starting game systems. Its required-types manifest checks real DMI directions, frames and nonempty pixels; `--negative-control` restores a wrong optic icon resource in a generated source copy.
- Missing initial states do not prove missing graphics: constructors, overlays, material recoloring and map overrides can supply them. Add new obtainable types to `tests/sprites/required-types.json` when static defaults are appropriate, or document and test their dynamic rendering. See `docs/sprite-audit.md` and its unresolved-candidate inventory.
