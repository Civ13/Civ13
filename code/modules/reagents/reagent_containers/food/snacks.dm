//	TODO: Make another way to eat, drink, piss, poo! Run out from crazyness of some UNITS system, with strange bitesizes etc
//		Make a system based on volumes: liters, milliliters, etc.
//	Redesign the smoking system, in which products will move into the body based on the "burning" process.
//	Redesign the rot and decay system, where the reagents in the products will be converted based on the "rot" process.
// 		Some will then go into the atmosphere, some into the earth, saturating it with reagents (chemicals and so on).
//		Some will attract vermins (orderlies), who will consume these substances.
//	Final redesign of drying system, based on reagents and "drying" process, but not only items creation, deletion.

//Items in the "Snacks" subcategory are food items that people actually eat. The key points are that they are created
//	already filled with reagents and are destroyed when empty. Additionally, they make a "munching" noise when eaten.

//Notes by Darem: Food in the "snacks" subtype can hold a maximum of 50 units Generally speaking, you don't want to go over 40
//	total for the item because you want to leave space for extra condiments. If you want effect besides healing, add a reagent for
//	it. Try to stick to existing reagents when possible (so if you want a stronger healing effect, just use Tricordrazine). On use
//	effect (such as the old officer eating a donut code) requires a unique reagent (unless you can figure out a better way).

//The nutriment reagent and bitesize variable replace the old heal_amt and amount variables. Each unit of nutriment is equal to
//	2 of the old heal_amt variable. Bitesize is the rate at which the reagents are consumed. So if you have 6 nutriment and a
//	bitesize of 2, then it'll take 3 bites to eat. Unlike the old system, the contained reagents are evenly spread among all
//	the bites. No more contained reagents = no more bites.

//It takes 23.3 units of drinks from full thirst to full saturation for standard drinks
//It takes 13.3 units of nutriment from full hunger to full satiety (or 15.2 units from near death starvation to full satiety) for standard nutriment
//Look at Chemistry-Reagents-Food-Drinks.dm for premaded nutriments and drinks

//There is only one way to add "nutriment" reagent correctly. And that are realised at New() procedure below.
//	If you want add another "nutriment" use list("flavour"=flavour strength, ...) as list of all flavours, that adds to "nutriment"
//  By the way you also may add any reagent with additional custom flavour(s)
//  If you want add already premade reagent (ANY), you must use that construction in in the definition of the item:
